The Annealing branch contains 3 main files. 
Hetero-Bulk contains the data for the structure to be read by LAMMPS.
in-1.SrTiO3-annealing is the input file where interatomic potentials are defined.
Moreover, NVE and NPT fixes are defined to simulate Thermal Annealing of the system.
It shoudld be noted that only one output file with the final anealed structure is dumped. 
the slurm-mp.sh file contains the information to submit the previous files as a job on a supercomputer cluster.
I used RIT's clusture availble to me as a student.
